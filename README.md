# InfoServer
A way of managing computers on the tier 1 side, as well as reducing the amount of
steps I have to take during the day.

## What does it do?
A lot, but mainly:
* Macro creation / editing / remote execution
* Remote info readings
* Remote command processing

## Why should I use it?
Well, who wants to walk down a flight of stairs, plug in a USB keyboard,
navigate some dumb menus, and then walk all the way back when you can set
up a macro and have it do it on it's own, as well as check how the machine is
doing from right at your desk?

## Can I use it on any platform?
As long as you have Java 10+ installed, absolutely.

## What version are we at?
Release 1 Beta 1

## What's your roadmap looking like?
Well, I usually add that to commits, but so far:
